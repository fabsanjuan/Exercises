1.1 Laptop Hardware.
From a technician's perspective, laptops are highly specialized pieces of equipment with a specific form factor.
This makes the repair difficulty highly variable between manufacturers and more difficult in general.
People tend to specialize in a particular brand as they learn specific processes for repair.

Batteries - most are lithium ion or lithium-ion polymer and designed to be fully charged. However, over years you will need to replace battery as the capacity diminishes each charge.
What are other forms of batteries?
    How do these batteries work? 
    Li-ion batteries work by moving Lithium ions across an electrolyte between electrodes.
    The electrodes are made of lithium compounds (lithium cobalt oxide) at the cathode and carbon compounds (graphite) at the anode. 
    The electrolyte is made of organic carbonates and a separator (thin polymer film) keeps the electrodes physically apart.
    When charging the ions move from cathode to anode and embed in anode (intercalation).
    When discharging the reverse happens and the movements from anode to cathode generates the current of electricity to power our devices.
    High energy density means they store more energy for their size.
    No memory effect means they do not need to be fully discharged before recharging.
    Low self discharge means they lose charge on their own at a slower rate.
People may have spare batteries when traveling that can easily disconnect and connect for a fresh charge.

Keyboard - the most used component as it is our primary input.
It is easy to replace as it is connected to the laptop with a single ribbon cable.
It is common to connect an external keyboard via USB.
Due to the smaller form factor function keys are used to replace missing keys on larger keyboard.
The keycaps themselves are fragile and maintenance of these should be done with extra caution.

SO-DIMM - small outline dual in-line memory module is a common form factor for laptops and other mobile devices.
Some laptops allow the addition of memory modules (as above) while others do not.

Storage - can either be as a SSD or a hard drive (magnetic disk)
Older laptops may have a 2 1/2 inc form factor magnetic disk while newer laptops likely have a solid state drive (no moving parts).
M.2 interface is used on a SSD to fit more storage in a smaller space due to its more compact size.
How do they work?
Replacing hard drives with SSDs is common due to benefits of performance. It is common to use drive imaging/cloning to move OS over.

Wireless - newer laptops have 802.11 and Bluetooth built-in, older laptops may still include Mini PCI or Mini PCI express.
Wireless cards are modular for easy replacement and comee as 802.11, WAN (cellular), PAN (Bluetooth).

Authentication - Generally in newer laptops there are 2 main options for authentication including a password OR biometrics or a possible combination of the two.
Biometrics includes the Software in the OS that determines its you plus the hardware (camera, fingerprint reader) examples include Window's Hello Face, Hello fingerprint

    Terminology:
    Form Factor - the shape of equipment expressed in 3d dimensions (h/w/d) or in terms of an industry standard item.
    CompTIA - Computer Technology Industry Association.



1.2 Laptop Displays.
Many laptops use an LCD display because it is lightweight and use little power. They are also relatively inexpensive to make.
What are disadvantages of LCD displays?
There are 3 different technologies for LCD displays: 
1. Twisted Nematic LCD. High response times for fast graphical changes. Bad viewing angles.
2. In Plane Switching LCD. Great color representation. More expensive.
3. Vertical alignment LCD. Middle point between the other 2 with great color and fast response times.

OLED displays - organic light emitting diode display has no backlight. The organic material emits light when provided with a current.
Light and thin and provide good color representation.
Don't forget that displays on laptops are often the highest above ground compoenent making it a target for network antennas.

backlight - since lCDs need a backlight the 2 most common are LEDs but on older laptops it could be CCFL.
Note that if using CCFL you will require an inverter as it runs on AC power.

Digitizer - in laptops that allow stylus or touch screen, the finger / pen serves as the input and is transduced to digital signals the computer can use.

    Terminology:
    LCD display - Liquid crystal display is a 
    CCFL - Cold cathode fluorescent lamp is a type of backlight 
    LED - Light emitting diode



1.3 Connecting Mobile Devices.
There are 2 primary types of connections in mobile devices wired and wireless.
The most common wired connection is the USB. It is designed for high speed communication. Now the USB-C connector is common.
As a technician, it is important to be aware of the different types of cables that are available and what type of data they transmit.
A legacy cable that may still be used is the DB-9 connector.
A newer form of wireless communication is NFC. It is used during phone payments in stores or unlocking doors with ID cards.
Another common form of wireless communication is Bluetooth - used for wireless headphones or connecting to vehicles.
Lastly, when public access points may not be available a phone hotspot can enable 802.11 connections through the mobile phone using the provider's network.

Mobile device accessories that can be connected:
stylus - a capacitive pen that allows for writing and interacting directly with a touchscreen. Different but similar to an active stylus.
external drawing pad - an external digitizer that can take stylus inputs
trackpad - replaces an external mouse on a laptop compact and travel friendly.
headsets - can be connected with a wire (USB, TRRS connection) or it can be wireless (Bluetooth).
external speakers - laptops and mobile devices generally have smaller speakers and lower sound quality and volume.
webcam - mobile devices have built-in cameras for video and multimedia communication.
docking station - setup preconfigured external connections in a single docking station that can be plugged directly to your laptop.



    Terminology:
    USB - Universal serial bus
    NFC - Near field communication
